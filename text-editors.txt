notepad++
  Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer") source
  code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages.  Running
  in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.

  Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in
  C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed
  and smaller program size.  By optimizing as many routines as possible
  without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world
  carbon dioxide emissions.  When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle
  down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.
